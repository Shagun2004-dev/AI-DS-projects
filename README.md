# Movie Recommendation System
Movie Recommendation System
A Python-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on genre similarity using Scikit-learn and Pandas.

Features
âœ… Takes movie name as input and suggests similar movies
âœ… Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for recommendations
âœ… Works on genre-based filtering
âœ… Fast & efficient using Scikit-learn & Pandas

How It Works
1.Loads movie dataset using Pandas
2.Converts Genres into numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization
3.Computes Cosine Similarity between movies
4.Takes user movie input and finds most similar movies
5.Prints top 5 recommended movies
